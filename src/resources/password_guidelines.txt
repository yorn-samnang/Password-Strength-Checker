Password Guidelines
===================

These are the guidelines to help you know and create a strong password.

===================
Strong Password:
- Is not in the common password list
- Has upper-case and lower-case characters, digits, and symbols
- Differs significantly from the username and does not contain it
- Does not contain simple patterns such as “1234”, “abcd”, or keyboard sequences
- Avoids using repeated characters (e.g., "aaaa" or "1111")
- Does not include the current year or any year-like pattern (e.g., 2024, 1999)
- Is at least 12 characters long to provide stronger security
- Uses a mix of unrelated words or phrases rather than predictable combinations

===================
Medium Password:
- Is not in the common password list
- Does not contain or resemble the username
- Does not contain simple sequences such as “1234”, “abcd”, or “qwerty”
- Does not repeat the same character four times in a row
- Does not include the current year or any year-like pattern
- Has a minimum length of 8 characters
- Has at least two of the following: uppercase, lowercase, digits
- Lacks some elements required for a strong password (e.g., symbols or length ≥ 12)

===================
Weak Password:
- Is empty or shorter than 6 characters
- Appears in the common password list
- Contains the username or parts of it
- Contains simple sequences like “1234”, “abcd”, or “qwerty”
- Contains 4 or more repeated characters (e.g., “aaaa”, “1111”)
- Includes the current year or any year-like pattern (e.g., 2024, 1999)
- Lacks character diversity (e.g., only lowercase, only digits)
- Scores too low based on length and character variety (score ≤ 2)

===================
We hope these guidelines help you identify the level of passwords (weak, medium, and strong).
